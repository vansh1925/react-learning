react ek virtual dom create krta hai ie jo normal browser vo har change par pure tree ko change krta hai but whereas virtual dom har baar apni tree 
ko compare krta hai purane virtul dom seab react main vituual dom bhi use nhi hota ab react fibre use hota which is an optimised algo
//more concised and sorted 
1️⃣ In a traditional browser DOM, whenever an update occurs, the entire UI is re-rendered, which is slow and inefficient.
2️⃣ React uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
3️⃣ When a state or prop changes:
    React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.
    It compares this new tree with the previous Virtual DOM (using a process called "diffing").
    Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM (reconciliation).
The browser removes the whole DOM and then recrates the whole DOM with the updated values this is called reload.

fibre->
✅ Asynchronous rendering → React can pause, resume, or prioritize updates instead of blocking the UI.
✅ Concurrent mode → React can break tasks into chunks, preventing UI freezes.
if ek change hua ab ek aur and ab teesra to rather than har ek change ko krna we can change all three at once so yeh algo yhi kaam krta hai 
ki vo unhe pause kr deta hai prioritize krta hai etc.

//Reconciliation is the algo behind what popularly known as the Virtual-DOM.
✔️ First, React compares prevVDOM with newVDOM.
✔️ Then, React updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.
✔️ React does NOT compare changes with the real DOM—it just applies them.

yeh sab createRoot se hota hai vo cotrol aur create krta hai and og dom main necessary changes ko add krta hai
